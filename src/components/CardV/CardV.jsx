           The foundation congratulates Noloyiso Madolo, 2019 beneficiary, on obtaining her code 10 drivers license. Her story is inspirational because after obtaining her learners license thru ZAM Foundation she didnâ€™t sit around waiting for a handout. Instead she hustled and managed to pay for her own driving lessons. Against all odds she made it. A true story of self-reliance. No handouts, just hand ups. Well done Noloyiso.
