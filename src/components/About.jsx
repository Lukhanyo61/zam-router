            <MDBCardText>
            The Zimkhitha Amanda Mashalaba Foundation herein referred to as ZAM Foundation, is a registered NPO (153-560 NPO) that aims to provide access to learners and driver training courses to young people from previously disadvantaged communities in order to improve their employability profile. The foundation focuses on young people who are 25 years and younger, who either have matric or are in the process of obtaining one. We have identified that a large number of these young people once they finish their matric, usually opt for job seeking as opposed to tertiary education due to lack of funds from their families. Our aim is to intervene during this period by providing them with the opportunity to acquire a skill that improves their chances of employment and can also be of great use to them in the future i.e. the ability and certification to drive a motor vehicle.
